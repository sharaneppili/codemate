CodeMate: An AI-Powered DSA Practice Environment
CodeMate is an interactive Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice platform designed to help developers of all levels sharpen their coding skills. This project goes beyond traditional coding environments by integrating AI to provide real-time, intelligent feedback and guidance, making the learning process more engaging and effective.

Features
AI-Powered Hints: Leveraging the power of the Ollama API, CodeMate provides subtle, approach-oriented hints for solving problems without giving away the direct solution. This encourages genuine problem-solving and critical thinking.

Multi-language Support: The platform offers a seamless, in-browser code editor with syntax highlighting for Python, Java, and C++.

Structured Practice: Users can select from a curated list of problems categorized by difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

Real-time Feedback: The environment runs user-submitted code against a series of test cases and provides detailed output, including console logs and pass/fail status for each case.

Time-Boxed Challenges: A built-in timer helps users simulate interview conditions and improve their time management skills.

Responsive Design: Built with Bootstrap, the user interface is clean, intuitive, and works on various screen sizes.
